# QCTiP 2026 Call for Submissions

Talks will be selected based on their scientific excellence, fit to the workshop theme,
and overall programme balance.
Submissions are expected that report on recent advances in quantum information and computation.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Applications of quantum computers
- Architectures for quantum computing
- Quantum algorithms
- Quantum compilation and circuit optimization
- Quantum error correction and fault tolerance
- Digital and analog simulation of quantum systems
- Theory of near-term quantum computing
- Verification of quantum software and hardware
- Error mitigation and benchmarking


All submissions must be made online via the following link [TO BE ADDED SOON].


### Talk submissions

A contributed talk submission must include a full technical manuscript
containing all technical details of the work.
While manuscripts available on online repositories such as arXiv are acceptable,
a PDF copy must still be uploaded. Only original research papers will be considered;
survey papers, PhD theses, and white papers are not eligible.

If your submission comprises multiple papers, please combine them into a single PDF file.
The first ten pages should clearly demonstrate the significance and suitability of the work for the workshop.
It is recommended-but not mandatory-that the submission begin with an Extended Abstract of
up to three pages, followed by the full paper.
The program committee may review the full paper at their discretion.
Submissions must be complete and include sufficient information to allow verification of results.

Presenters are expected to attend the workshop in person. Submissions not selected for talks may be
offered the opportunity to present as posters, unless deemed off-topic or technically unsound by the program committee.

### Poster only submission

If you intend to submit a poster-only contribution, please select the poster track during submission.
A brief abstract of 1-3 pages is sufficient for poster submissions.
