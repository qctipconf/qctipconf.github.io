# QCTiP 2026 Registration

A registration link will be made available here after registration opens. Please note that **tickets will be sold on a first-come first-served basis**
and based on the interest in previous QCTiP editions, we expect tickets may sell out before registration closes.


# Accommodation

## Important notice

A major event, the [Skoll World Forum](https://skoll.org/) will take place later the same week as QCTiP 2026 in central Oxford.
While Skoll does not directly affect the main QCTiP event in the Mathematical Institute, accommodation will be more difficult to find
for the night of Tuesday the 21st April and after. For this reason we **strongly recommend that participants purchase a ticket for QCTiP as soon as possible
and then book accommodation immediately after purchasing a ticket**. 


## College Accommodation

We have reserved a limited number of accommodations at St Anne's College that participants can book via
[St Anne's College's website](https://www.st-annes.ox.ac.uk/conferences-bb/accommodation/book-conference/) using the below code.

Use this code: **QCTIP44815**
 
Please note that the **booking link will expire on Monday 23rd February at 9am** and therefore bookings must be made before this date.

## Recommended Hotels

A list of recommended hotels will be made available here closer to the conference dates


# Visa Information

International attendees should check UK visa requirements well in advance. More information will be provided on the registration page.
