### Tickets and Registration

Thanks to the generous support of our sponsors we are able to lower early-bird
registration fees. Please note, however, that the number of early-bird tickets
has been limited -- if all early bird tickets sell out before the deadline (27th February),
we will switch to regular rate tickets earlier.


Furthermore, the number of student tickets
has been limited -- if all student tickets sell out, please purchase regular rate tickets.
Only those participants are eligible to purchase student tickets who study for a degree but
have not yet received a doctorate.


We are able to offer the Gala Dinner in the beautiful Oxford Town Hall as a free option,
which will take place in the evening of the 21st April (conference dates are 20-22 April).
However, we request participants to sign up only if they know they will be able to attend.

### Travel Support

number of attendees. If you require financial help in order to be able to attend, then
please fill in the following online form -- you will be asked for a justification, and
only those with strong and specific reasons for needing support may receive it.

### Cancellation Policy

# Accommodation

## Important notice

The [Skoll World Forum](https://skoll.org/) will take place later in the same week as QCTiP 2026
in central Oxford. While this does not affect the main QCTiP activities at the Mathematical Institute,
accommodation is likely to be particularly difficult to secure for the night of Tuesday 21th April and onwards.
For this reason, we **strongly recommend purchasing a QCTiP ticket as soon as possible and booking accommodation immediately thereafter.**


## St Anne's College
