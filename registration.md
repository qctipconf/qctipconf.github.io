# Accommodation

## Important notice

A major event, the [Skoll World Forum](https://skoll.org/) will take place later the same week as QCTiP 2026 in central Oxford.
While Skoll does not directly affect the main QCTiP event in the Mathematical Institute, accommodation will be more difficult to find
for the night of Tuesday the 21st April and after. For this reason we **strongly recommend that participants purchase a ticket for QCTiP as soon as possible
and then book accommodation immediately after purchasing a ticket**. 


## St Anne's College
